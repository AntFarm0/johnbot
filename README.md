# johnbot
This is a basic skeleton of a chatbot. In the future you can definitely implement your own machine learning models, algorithms, and even more data into the bot to 
make it more advanced.

Johnbot.py: Provides main functions to create responses for different sentence inputs into the program.

Johnbotv2.py: Brings everything together. Uses the functions from Johnbot.py and adds a simple tkinter GUI and text to speech feature. Run this on the command prompt to 
activate the actual program ">python johnbotv2.py"
   - Tell john "can i teach you something?", then you can teach him new words.

combdict.json: Contains the different responses and combinations that the bot can recognize, which will be appended to if you teach johnbot new words. Highly 
customizable.

word-data.xlsx: Contains the actual data and words that johnbot can recognize. Also highly customizable.
